Introduction to Visual Basic.NET

Visual Basic.NET now truly supports Object Oriented Programming, including features such as 
inheritance, interfaces, parameterized constructors and overloading. With Object Oriented 
Programming, data takes center stage, supporting not only  reference types but also value types. 
However, pitfalls await the unwary for those who do not understand the nuances of 
copying and boxing. 

Error handling takes a major step forward with Structured Exception Handling.
You can throw away your old On Error GoTo statement. You won't be needing it.

For those more inclined to C#, I will be providing examples in both Visual Basic.NET and C#.
This will be bi-lingual education at its finest. We'll begin with a fast-paced tutorial with LOTS of
code.

We'll conclude with a brief description of the differences between VB.NET and C#.
